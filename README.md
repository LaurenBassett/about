# Hello World! 
My name is Lauren Bassett, I am a Computer Scientist and Economist and lifelong learner. My technical and academic passions include cyber security, data semantics, and networks. I expect to graduate in December of 2020 with a B.S. of Engineering in Computer Science and a B.S. in Business Economics, as well as minors in Mathematics and Statistics, and the Undergraduate Certificate in Cyber Security. I am active on campus in both social and educational groups. I am a Peer Tutor in the Gatton College of Business and Economics for Economic Statistics, Microeconomics, and Macroeconomics. I am also involved in both the Society for Women Engineers and the Women in Economics Club, which I helped to start. I have assisted the Formula Racing Team writing Arduino Code for their gear shift. Socially, I am a member of Alpha Delta Pi Sorority, where I served as the Director of Alumnae Engagement. My guilty pleasure is Dungeons and Dragons, which I play as often as I can! 

This repository contains lots of relevant non-code specfic things I find interesting, have worked hard on, or want to share. My programming highlights can be found on my profile.
